### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I was very happy to learn the element to strikethrough a word or number, and extremely excited when it worked!
<!-- <html>
          <div class="col-8 col-sm-6 new-price">
                  <p class="price">$149.99</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-4 col-sm-6">
                  <p><s><small class="strike">$169.99</small></s></p>
                </div>
              </div>
</html>  -->

I could add all of style.css here, but it'll be too long. I origanilly looked everything up, font, colors, etc. and found everything here included (thats why you read everything given), but although frustrating, I was also feeling pretty good of how close I matched with what the original css was used. 
Although I am still very new, and trying my best in this css, I feel very good about how it all turned out. And pretty unbelievable to see how I occomplished it.

### Continued development

As I started this project, I was in learning Front-End in Northwestern Bootcamp. Although they do an excelent job in teaching, I am completely new at this and want to practice what I am learning. Its been a month since I started as of now (9/18/22), and I am still a little lost, but with this project I was very proud at what I did without help. I know that I want to know everything right away, and change the things within this project to look exactly like the product-preview, but I am happy with what I made. I found it extremely useful using bootstrap, as it helped tremendously. Also trying to remember what I learned the first week in bootcamp of what ever style.css I could use for this project. Looking up in google helped because I learned other useful info. that I didn't know could be used.
